  <p>In 2006, the Swedish Shipowners' Association together with Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg School of Business,
      Economics and Law started the maritime competence centre Lighthouse. During the years new partners joined the ship: Vinnova,
      Region Västra Götaland and the Swedish Maritime Administration. In the first phase which continues to 2015,
      about 235 million SEK in external research grants and 800 million SEK in added value have strengthening the research and
      education in a number of important thematic areas,which means that Lighthouse is well positioned to take the next step.
      A high academic level of research and education is an important base for the Swedish shipping and maritime industry to increase their
       innovation ability and competitiveness.</p>

  <p>Highland Light Station, also known as Cape Cod Light, is located on Outer Cape Cod within Cape Cod National Seashore in North Truro.
     Commissioned by George Washington and established in 1797 as the 20th light station in the United States,
     the original 45-foot tall wooden tower and keeper's dwelling were built more than 500 feet from the edge of a 125-foot-tall clay cliff.
     A new brick lighthouse was erected near the original tower in 1831. The present 66-foot-tall brick light tower, keeper's house, and generator shed replaced the previous structures in 1857.
     An enclosed walkway connects the tower and the one-and-one-half-story, L-shaped, Queen-Anne-style keeper's dwelling.
     Erosion of the steep cliff throughout the years brought the present light station around 100 feet from the cliff's edge by the early 1990s.
     Using funds raised by the Truro Historical Society combined with state and Federal grants, Highland Light Station was successfully moved 450 feet back to safer
     ground. After the 18-day move, the light was relit on November 3, 1996, and is an active aid to navigation.
     Today, the keeper's house features a gift shop and museum exhibits and a dedicated staff provides tours of the tower.</p>
